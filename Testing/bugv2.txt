adding a lot to v2, bring up from nothing (the game file that is)
- Important things I want to include that v1 didn't have:
    - Splitting
    - Currency
        - Doubling
        - Balance
        - Rebuy Option
        - etc. I'm sure I'll think of more 
    - Multiple Players
    - Cleaner Functions, seperating ConsoleOut and Debug functions, these really stuffed the Game.h file and made thing hard to find
    - Add more to Player and Dealer classes, don't need to call everything from Game
    - Better state handling, Pass the current State in and Let the game do it 
    - Bring the game up first, then add balance tracking/doubling - should be easy once everything else works
    - Put player option under name so when they stand, it would displau:
                HAND 1             HAND 2
                -----              -----
                9♥ 5♦              Q♣ T♦
