adding a lot to v2, bring up from nothing (the game file that is)
- Important things I want to include that v1 didn't have:
    - Splitting
    - Currency
        - Doubling
        - Balance
        - Rebuy Option
        - etc. I'm sure I'll think of more 
    - Multiple Players
    - Cleaner Functions, seperating ConsoleOut and Debug functions, these really stuffed the Game.h file and made thing hard to find
    - Add more to Player and Dealer classes, don't need to call everything from Game
    - Better state handling, Pass the current State in and Let the game do it 
    - Bring the game up first, then add balance tracking/doubling - should be easy once everything else works
    - Put player option under name so when they stand, it would displau:
                HAND 1             HAND 2
                -----              -----
                9♥ 5♦              Q♣ T♦
                Total: 14          Total: 20 
                STAND              STAND
AFTER SECOND COMMIT:
    - Running well, Just added Currency to the game, also doubling down
    - UI Is CLI and very simple, can focus more on that after fully functional
    - Future plans to set up tests, would be cool to run this as a simulation to run data off of

    Some Bug Still
    - Double down state displays Stand?
    - Payouts can be weird sometimes
    - Honesty haven't kept track of the total balance of the players TODO
        - need to set up something to do this 
    - No splitting... ugh 


Splitting Troubles
- Starting the split functionality
- Thoughts
    - Could create a new Player and add the second card (take it away from original Player instance)
    - Set the ID to the original instance, 
        - with this it would be cool to then not just loop through the vector but instead, loop through each ID (could get complicated)
- GO BACK AND CHANGE p.currentHand.Add(dealer.Deal()); to Hit
DOUBLE AFTER SPLITTING (Need to add this soon) -> Complicated with the current way I'm doing it.
PAYOUTS AFTER SPLITTING
